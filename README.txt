Program description:

	this is a data visualization program meant to create a forest plot based on user input. 
	for now it only supports proportions.

	-> to add an entry, your data should be in the form of
		n = sample size
		p = # of cases within sample size n
	
	-> to load a file (CSV only), the file should be in the format of
		p1,n1
		p2,n2
		.
		.
		.

	the program will automatically calculate the proportion for each sample, the 95% confidence interval, 
	and the summary statistics for all samples.
